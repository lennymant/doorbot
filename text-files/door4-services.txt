- **If a Marketing Budget is Present:**
  - Ask how they calculate it and find out their approximate budget.
  - Reassure them that we work closely with clients on growth and focus on the value of leads/sales.

- **If No Marketing Budget is Present:**
  - Ask what kind of client they are, based on turnover:
    - a) \<£2m turnover.
    - b) £2-10m turnover.
    - c) £10-50m turnover.
    - d) £50m+ turnover.
  - **For Clients Under £10m:**
    - Smaller clients might spend the equivalent of a "medium salary" on agency services.
    - Larger clients may spend 4-5x that amount.
    - We work with businesses that understand the required investment and rigorously measure ROI.
  - **For Clients Over £10m:**
    - Our services are priced as a combined offer across SEO, PPC, and UX.
